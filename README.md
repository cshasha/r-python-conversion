# scRNA-seq Analysis: Conversion between R and Python

This repository demonstrates conversion of SingleCellExperiment objects in R Bioconductor to AnnData objects in Scanpy. Example workflows showing implementation of typical scRNA-seq analysis in Scanpy are included. In general, preprocessing and quality control tools are significantly more limited in Scanpy (compared to Bioconductor), so for these examples, preprocessing and QC are done in R. However, Python is generally considered to be superior to R for analyzing large-scale datasets and machine learning.
